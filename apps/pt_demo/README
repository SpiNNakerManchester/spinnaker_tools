This directory contains a "Path Tracer" demo for SpiNNaker. It was
originally written by Andrew Webb and has been kept up to date by
Steve Temple.

Two applications run on SpiNNaker. The "aggregator" application runs
on core 1 of chip (0,0) and it collects results from the "tracer"
application which runs on cores 2-16 of chip (0, 0) and cores 1-16 of
all of the other chips.

On the host, an OpenGL application "drawer" runs which gets data sent
from the "aggregator" and displays it in a window. The tracing is
started by sending an SCP command to the "aggregator" from a trigger
program "pt_trig" run on the host.

Building and running the demo...

1) Compile the host and SpiNNaker code
   (you'll need "pthread" and "freeglut" libraries installed...)

   > make

2) Start the "drawer"

   > ./drawer 600 &

3) Load the application(s) onto SpiNNaker (substitute your IP address)

   > ybug 192.168.240.253 < pt_demo.ybug

4) Trigger the application (substitute IP address).

   > ./pt_trig 192.168.240.253 600 10 16

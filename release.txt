#	SpiNNaker Software Tools - Release Notes
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.0.1 - Bugfix of barriers used during boot.

This version fixes an issue where a random set of chips would not appear after
boot.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 3.0.0 - Merging of changes made on a different branch of the tools 
(Breaking change due to version checking bug in previous releases.)

Packaging/build changes:

* The SC&MP boot binary and boot configuration files have been moved from
  boot to tools/boot.

* A Makefile.common file has been created to contain common build directives.

* By default, intermediate files for ARM builds are made in build/arm and for 
  GNU builds are made in build/gnu.  Folders are created automatically.
  
* mkaplx now expects a .nm file rather than a .elf file.  Rules for building
  the nm file are in Makefile.common.
  
* sark and spin1_api have a Makefile each instead of make.gnu and make.arm.  
  Users can specify which of ARM or GNU is required by using GNU=0 or GNU=1
  respectively.
  
* A top level Makefile is included to build both sark and spin1_api.

* SC&MP can be built with GNU tools.

* Support for C++ has been added to Makefile.common, removing cpp_app.make.
  C++ application can therefore rely on the app.make Makefile.

* Tools are all Windows compatible.

SCP Command Changes:

* P2P messages to 255, 255 will now respond with the P2P id of the chip used to
  boot the machine.

* CMD_INFO now additionally returns the P2P address of the chip considered to be
  the nearest Ethernet to the chip, and the IP address currently assigned to the
  chip.  Note that the IP address can be set even if the Ethernet is not
  connected.  The default IP address is 0.0.0.0.
  
Spin1 API Changes:

* Diagnostics are now stored directly in the diagnostics data structure,
  allowing applications to read this at any point during the execution.

* Additional diagnostics have been added to indicate the number of times the
  timer callback over-ran, and the maximum number of queued timer callbacks
  at any time during the simulation (i.e. how far behind this core got at
  worst).
  
* Added the ability to pause and resume simulations through spin1_pause and 
  spin1_resume.  During pause, a simulation can still communicate using SDP; 
  only the timer tick is currently disabled.  Simulations can be resumed 
  synchronously or asynchronously as per spin1_start.

* Added the ability to start a simulation in paused mode i.e. to start all the
  interrupt handling except the timer tick.  Simulations started paused are
  done so asynchronously - spin1_resume is expected to be used when
  synchronisation is required.
  
ybug changes:

* ybug no longer needs CRC32 to be installed to work.

* It is no longer necessary to set SPINN_PATH.  Instead, boot files will be
  searched for in the tools/boot folder by default.
  
Bug Fixes:

* Some fixes have been made to the booting process in SC&MP. Specifically
  the P2P routing table construction algorithm now obeys the blacklist.

* A bug in the version number checking has been fixed.  This is a breaking
  change, as the version number of SC&MP must now be less than or equal to the
  version number of the running application.

* Some race conditions in the PT Demo application's visualiser program have
  been fixed.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.0 - Implement FPGA "xreg" facility

This allows a set of writes to FPGA control registers to be performed
after bitfile loading. Specialised facility not needed by most people!

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.1 - Fix C++ constructor calling.

Fixed a bug in 2.0.0 which prevented C++ constructors being called on
application startup. NB: C++ only supported under GCC.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.0 - Semantic versioning, robust boot, CMD_INFO, more efficient
app-load and more. (Breaking change)

Packaging/build changes:

* The version numbers of SC&MP, SARK, SpiNN1 API, ybug, bmpc and friends will
  use 'Semantic Versioning' going forward. In brief, versions are now
  of the form major.minor.patch. A change in major version indicates a
  non-backward compatible change. A change in minor version indicates a new
  (but backward-compatible) feature release. A patch change indicates minor or
  bug fix style changes. See semver.org for full details.

* Applications check their compatibility with the running version of SC&MP
  before starting, producing an RTE_VER error if an incompatible software
  version is discovered.

* C++ is now supported for writing SpiNNaker applications. An example C++
  application and Makefile is included in apps/hello_cpp.

SCP command changes:

* Any SCP commands addressed to chip (255, 255) will be routed to the chip used
  to boot the machine. During machine boot, this is the only P2P address which
  should be used to communicate with the machine.

* Any SCP command which takes system-wide action (e.g. signalling) should be
  sent to the chip used to boot the system which may not be chip (0, 0).
  Commands should instead be addressed to chip (255, 255) which are routed to
  the chip used to boot the machine.

* The CMD_VER command format has changed to accommodate the new version
  numbering scheme:
    - The top 16 bits of arg2 of SCP response now contains 0xFFFF.
    - The software name string in the SCP data field is now followed by a
      second string defining the software version. Both strings are terminated
      by a null byte.

* The P2P address returned by CMD_VER in the top 16 bits of arg1 in SCP
  response will be 0xFFFF during machine boot but, once booted, will contain
  the P2P address of the responding chip. (NB: only applies when communicating
  with monitor processors.)

* The flood-fill mechanism used when loading applications now supports the
  sending of multiple regions which will be ORed together enabling more
  efficient loading of irregularly shaped regions of a machine.

* A new SCP command, CMD_INFO, has been added which compactly returns a summary
  of the state of a chip. Includes: the states of all cores, list of working
  links, sizes of the largest free SDRAM, SysRAM and MC routing entry blocks.


SC&MP changes:

* Links, cores or whole chips may be blacklisted and automatically mapped out
  on boot based on configuration data stored in Serial-ROM on SpiNN-5 boards.

* The MC-packet-based signalling and the signal 'count' (and similar)
  mechanisms can now function on machines with arbitrary dead chips and links.

* A new, more robust, boot mechanism has been introduced.
  - The dimensions of the machine no longer need to be known when booting.
  - Any Ethernet-connected board may be used to boot the machine.
  - Chip (0, 0) need not exist, e.g. in strangely-shaped machines produced by
    future versions of 'spalloc'.
  - The boot process no longer relies on hand-tuned delay parameters and should
    function reliably and as-fast-as-possible on any size of machine.
  - It is possible to determine when a machine has completely booted by polling
    with a CMD_VER command addressed to (255, 255) and waiting for the P2P
    address to resolve to something other than (255, 255).

* LED0 now shows (more) useful information by default:
  - During boot, all LEDs are turned off.
  - Once the whole machine has completely booted, a sweeping pattern is
    displayed indicating that the system is alive.
  - LEDs indicate approximate load: brighter means heavier load. Note that if
    any application core is in use on a chip, the LED will be dimly lit, even
    if that core is sleeping.
  - Rapid flashing indicates that a core has encountered a runtime-error.
  - To allow application control of the LEDs, the sv->led_period variable may
    be used as in previous versions of SC&MP.

SARK changes:

* Added sark_tag_ptr which looks up the addresses of tagged blocks of SDRAM.

* Added rtr_alloc_max which gives the largest contiguous block of free MC
  routing table entries.

* Before a SARK/SpiNN1 API based application runs, it checks that the version
  of SC&MP the machine is booted with is compatible, according to the Semantic
  Versioning scheme. If it is not, the core immediately goes into the RTE_VER
  state.

SpiNN1 API changes:

* spin1_callback_on now supports setting of both MC_PACKET_RECEIVED and
  MCPL_PACKET_RECEIVED or FR_PACKET_RECEIVED and FRPL_PACKET_RECEIVED as FIQ
  (priority = -1) interrupts.

ybug changes:

* The 'boot' command now uses sensible default values for its two arguments.
  For most users, typing 'boot' should be sufficient for any size of machine.
* The 'sp' command given without arguments now switches to the 'root-chip',
  i.e. the one used to boot the machine.

bmpc changes:

* A new 'board_info' command and example 'board.info' file are provided which
  allow cores, links and whole chips to be blacklisted on a SpiNN-5 board.

Bug-fixes:

* phys_cpu is now correctly set for the monitor in the VCPU struct.

* The stop signal now reliably frees resources allocated on chips with no cores
  loaded.


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.34 - Added fixed-route packet handling

Routines to deal with fixed route packets added to SARK and spin1_api.
SARK gets two routines to set and get the fixed routing register in
the router

	void rtr_fr_set (uint route);   // Sets route (using virtual cores)
	uint rtr_fr_get (void);		// Gets route (actually a copy of)

spin1_api gets two new events FR_PACKET_RECEIVED, FRPL_PACKET_RECEIVED
and adds a routine to send a FR packet (which has similar args to the
MC packet send routine).

	uint spin1_send_fr_packet (uint key, uint data, uint load);

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.33 - Writes to VIC are unbuffered

A bug which was caused by the ARM968 cores buffering writes to the VIC
has been fixed by forcing all writes to the VIC to be unbuffered. This
will slow applications very slightly.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.33 - Reverse IPTags

A new type of IPTag is available which is used to receive UDP packets
and forward them to a specific core on a specific SpiNNaker chip. Three
parameters are needed to set this up

Port number   the UDP port in incoming packets
P2P address   of the destination chip. A 16 bit value.
Core port     on the destination chip. An 8 bit value with core number
     	      in the lower 5 bits and "port" number in the upper 3. The
	      port should not normally be zero

When a UDP packet is received, the IPTag table is searched to see if
a reverse IPTag exists for the given port number. If it does and the
UDP payload is small enough to fit in an SDP packet, then an SDP packet
containing the UDP payload is sent to the specified chip and core. The
IPTag table is also updated with the reply information (IP address and
port) so that replies from the SpiNNaker core using the same IPTag will
be routed back to the original sender.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.33 - "ybug" Changes

The syntax of the "iptag" command has been changed to be slightly more
logical and expandable. This is incompatible with earlier syntax so
scripts will need to be changed.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.32 - SDP non-routing flag

If bit 5 of the flag byte of an SDP packet is set, then the packet is
not routed via P2P but goes to a local core. This is useful to talk to
an Ethernet-connected chip via the Ethernet interface without having
to know its point-to-point address.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.32 - SARK Router Routines

A minor change has been made to two routines for router control. The
function "rtr_mc_load" now has a fourth argument which is an AppID.
If this is non-zero it is used to set the AppID field in the router
table copy (which is primarily a debugging feature). If this field is
zero them the AppID of the core calling "rtr_mc_load" is used instead.

The function "rtr_mc_set" now has an AppID passed in as the top 8 bits
of the "route" parameter. As above, if non-zero this sets the AppID
in the router table copy, otherwise the AppID of the calling core is
used.

These changes have been made so that when a router table is loaded
from a host via SC&MP, the AppID can be correctly set by the host.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.31 - Ethernet output

To allow SpiNNaker chips in multiboard systems to send output to their
'nearest' Ethernet connected chip, some new system variables are
available. In this case 'nearest' is defined as the chip on the same
board which has an Ethernet interface. For example, all chips on the
same board as P2P address (8,4) (which has an Ethernet interface),
have a variable set to (8,4). The new variables are all shorts (16
bits) with X coordinate in the high byte and Y coordinate in the low
byte.

sv->eth_addr    P2P address of 'nearest' Ethernet chip. If you make your
		own SDP packets to send to the outside world via
		Ethernet you should set the "dest_addr" field to this
		value.

sv->dbg_addr    Initialised to be the same as "sv->eth_addr". This is
		used by "io_printf" (to IO_STD) to send printing to a
		host. You can set it (eg to (0,0)) to change the route
		that "io_printf" uses.

sv->board_addr  The address of this chip relative to the bottom
		left chip on this board (ie goes up to (7,7) on a
		48-chip board.

Note that, after booting in "ybug", the default IPTag for Tubotron output
will only be set on the root chip (0,0). IPTags for other Ethernet-attached
chips will have to be set up manually. It may be possible to automate this
in future...

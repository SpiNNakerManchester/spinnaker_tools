* @mainpage spinnaker_tools: SpiNNaker API, SARK, SC&MP, and Spin1 API
*
* The SpiNNaker low-level software tools consist of:
*
* * [spinnaker.h](spinnaker_8h.html) &mdash; The low-level definition of how to access the SpiNNaker
*   hardware
* * SARK &mdash; The SpiNNaker Application Runtime Kernel (see [sark.h](sark_8h.html)).
*   This can be considered to be the C library of SpiNNaker.
* * SC&MP &mdash; The SpiNNaker Control and Monitor Processor (see [scamp.h](scamp_8h.html)).
*   This can be considered to be the operating system of SpiNNaker.
* * Spin1 API &mdash; The SpiNNaker API runtime environment for simulation
*   applications (see [spin1_api.h](spin1_api_8h.html)).
*
* There is also the [Board Management Processor (BMP)][bmp], but this is
* normally transparent to user code (and not usually addressable).

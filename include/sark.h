// Note that default stack top and length are specified in the linker script.
// The sizes below define individual sizes for three modes of four used by
// SARK. The sizes of individual stacks and the stack top can be modified at
// startup by using "sark_config". The size of the SYS mode stack is the
// difference between the sum of the three stack sizes given here and the
// overall stack length from the linker script. The default is for a stack
// length of 2048 and hence a SYS stack of 1152 bytes. All of these values
// must be a multiple of 4!

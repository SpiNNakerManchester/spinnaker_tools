//! \brief A simple "printf" routine.
//!
//! The first argument is a 'stream' which is
//! either a constant (#IO_BUF, #IO_STD, #IO_DBG, #IO_NULL) or a pointer to a
//! character array which will be filled in as in "sprintf". No checks for
//! buffer overflow are made for this latter case! The range of formats is
//! very limited to minimise code size. The maximum width for integer
//! fields is 16.The maximum width for the 16.16 fixed point format is 25.
//! Don't exceed these maxima!
//!
//! The four constants provide 4 possible output streams for the output
//! string. IO_STD will send the string as an SDP packet back to the
//! host. IO_BUF will place the string in a buffer in SDRAM while IO_NULL
//! will ignore the string. IO_DBG is not currently implemented.
//!
//! Formats are:
//! - \c \%c - character
//! - \c \%s - string - can be eg \c \%8s for right justification
//! - \c \%d - signed integer (also <tt>\%8d</tt>, <tt>\%06d</tt>, etc)
//! - \c \%u - signed integer (also <tt>\%4u</tt>, <tt>\%06u</tt>, etc)
//! - \c \%x - integer in hex (also <tt>\%4x</tt>, <tt>\%08x</tt>, etc)
//! - \c \%z - integer in hex, exactly _N_ digits
//! - \c \%n.mf - 16.16 fixed point with width _n_, precision _m_
//!

\brief Cancel a timer event that was previously scheduled.

The ID that was allocated when the timer was created must be given in case
the timer has already executed and the event has possibly been recycled.
This means that a timer event which may be cancelled must be allocated by
event_new(), the ID noted and the event then scheduled with
timer_schedule().

It is potentially quite difficult to cancel a timer at the head
of the timer queue so in that case the timer is replaced with a
placeholder with "proc" set to NULL and the placeholder is left
to terminate on the timer interrupt.

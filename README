README file for SpiNNaker Low-Level Software Tools - Release 3.0.1
==================================================================


1) Edit the setup file so that it points to your installations of
   ARM and/or GNU software development tools. You only need one of
   these two tools installed to build standard applications.

   Search for the string "EDIT HERE" to find the two edit points.

   The version of the GNU tools that was used to test this release is

     gcc version 4.9.3 20150529 (release) [ARM/embedded-4_9-branch revision 227977]

   This (and more recent versions) can be downloaded from this web site

     https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

   The version of the ARM tools that was used to test this release is

     ARM C/C++ Compiler, RVCT4.0 [Build 400]


2) Source the setup file in the directory in which it lives

   > source ./setup


3) make SARK and spin1_api for ARM or GNU tools
   (you will probably only want to do one of these)

   > make GNU=0	        # If you are using ARM tools
   > make        		# If you are using GNU tools

   Note that you may see some compiler warnings during these builds.

     ARM: Warning: A1581W: Added 2 bytes of padding at address ...
     ARM: Warning: C3017W: cpsr may be used before being set

   These are harmless and can be ignored.

5) There is a generic make file which works for both C and C++ (make/app.make)
   which is used to build simple applications. The preferred way to use this
   is to create a Makefile which looks something like:

       # A single-file C app called 'example.c' or
       # a single-file C++ app called 'example.cpp'
       APP := example
       include $(SPINN_DIRS)/make/app.make

   The following variables may be set at the top of your Makefile, in
   environment variables or given as arguments to 'make':

   APP - to select the default source file to build (required)

   GNU - to choose ARM or GNU tools (GNU=1)

   THUMB - to choose to generate ARM or Thumb code (THUMB=0)

   DEBUG - to include debugging info in the ELF files (DEBUG=0)

   API - if you want link with "spin1_api" or not (API=1)

   GP - if your GNU binaries don't have names like "arm-none-eabi-gcc"
        (GP=arm-none-eabi)


6) Go into the "apps/hello" directory to build your first SpiNNaker app.

   > cd apps/hello
   > make         # GNU tools
   > make GNU=0   # ARM tools

   This should make "hello.aplx", which is an executable file that
   you can load into SpiNNaker


7) Now start "tubotron" on your workstation to get output from
   the program as it runs

   > tubotron &

   Note that if you see this error message when you start "tubotron"

     failed to create socket: Address already in use

   it is usually because there is already a tubotron (or tubogrid)
   running and it needs exclusive use of a UDP port.


8) Now start "ybug" to bootstrap your SpiNNaker system and load and run
   the "hello" application. You'll need to know the IP address of (one of) your
   boards to do this - here we'll use 192.168.240.253. If you aren't sure what
   state your board is in you should reset it by pressing the reset button.

   > ybug 192.168.240.253

   You should see a start-up message and then a prompt. At the prompt
   type the following.

   > boot
   > app_load hello.aplx . 1 16
   > ps

   This loads the code into core 1 on a single SpiNNaker chip and
   assigns it an application ID of 16. You should see a "Hello world"
   message in the Tubotron. The "ps" command displays the status of
   every core on the SpiNNaker chip.

   The "hello" application also sends output to an internal I/O buffer
   on the chip. You can see this by using the "iobuf" command and
   telling it which core's buffer to display

   > iobuf 1

   Finally, to clear the I/O buffer and stop the application you can
   use the "app_stop" command to remove all applications with a given
   ID and any resources they have used. Exit "ybug" with "quit"

   > app_stop 16
   > ps
   > quit

   Note: If you have a SpiNN-1, SpiNN-2 or SpiNN-3 board and want all the LEDs
   on those boards to function (not just the green LED0), the one of the
   following alternative boot commands may be used:

   > boot scamp.boot spin1.conf
   > boot scamp.boot spin2.conf
   > boot scamp.boot spin3.conf

9) Now build a more complex application (called "simple"!) which runs on
   4 chips

   > cd ../simple
   > make

   Start "ybug" again to load and run the code. There should be no
   need to run the "boot" command again. The command to load a program
   to multiple chips is "app_load" and it has to be told which chips
   ("all" for all of them), which core (just 1 again) and an application
   ID (17 this time)

   Because this application runs on multiple cores, the startup of the
   cores needs to be synchronised. When a core reaches its
   synchronisation point (or barrier) it enters a wait state known as
   SYNC0. To allow the cores to proceed beyond the barrier a "signal"
   has to be sent to all cores to cause them to proceed. The "app_sig"
   command is used to do this, sending the signal "sync0". In this
   example, the cores reach their barrier very quickly and so it is
   OK to send the signal immediately after the "app_load". In other
   cases, a delay may be necessary.

   > ybug 192.168.240.253
   > app_load simple.aplx all 1 17
   > ps
   > app_sig all 17 sync0
   > ps

   This program runs for around 10 seconds, flashing red LEDs as it goes.
   (Your board may not have red LEDs). Output from this example goes to
   the internal I/O buffer and you can view it with the "iobuf" command.
   You can clean up with "app_stop" again and quit "ybug".

   > iobuf 1
   > app_stop 17
   > ps
   > quit


10) There are some more examples in the "apps" directory. Each of these
    has a "xxx.ybug" file which contains the "ybug" commands to run the
    application. It also contains, as comments, the commands you need
    to use to build the application and start any visualisation programs
    that the application needs. These examples include

    hello - Hello World (as above)

    simple - a contrived demo of the SpiNNaker API

    data_abort - causes a data abort to demonstrate debugging

    interrupt - demonstrates a bare-metal interrupt handler

    ring - shows how to set up routing tables for core-to-core comms

    random - random number generation and simple graphics

    pt_demo - a path tracing program - quite complex - see its own README

    heat_demo - a heat diffusion example (precompiled Linux visualiser)

    gdb_test - shows how to use the GDB debugger with SpiNNaker. See
    the "gdb-spin" document in the "docs" directory for instructions.


11) There is documentation for SARK, "ybug", "gdp-spin" and the Spin1
    API in the "docs" directory.


12) SpiNNaker systems mostly communicate using UDP/IP with port numbers
    in the range 17890-17899. Specifically, 17892 is used for Tubotron
    and Tubogrid, 17893 is used by SpiNNaker (eg by "ybug") and 17894
    is often used by visualisers. If you have a firewall blocking any
    of these ports, you may encounter problems and it's worth checking
    the firewall before blaming anything else!

    Similarly, you may only have one visualiser (such as Tubotron) on
    each port at any one time. So you may see a mesage to the effect
    that the port is in use if you try to start a visualiser when one
    is already running and using the same port.

13) Some visualisers (tubotron/tubogrid) use the Perl-Tk library which
    may not be installed by default on your machine. This can be
    installed as follows

      sudo apt-get install perl-tk		# Ubuntu, etc
      sudo yum     install perl-Tk		# Fedora, etc
